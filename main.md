### Hero Section

**Executive Coaching & Strategic Advisory**

The questions change when you reach the top.

Most executives reach senior leadership by mastering execution. The work at this level asks for something different: pattern recognition across complexity, building organizations that outlast individual tenure, making consequential decisions when the full picture remains uncertain.

### The Questions You're Holding

**Fewer Thinking Partners**
As you move up, the number of people who can genuinely engage with what you're navigating decreases. Your team needs direction. Your board expects confidence. The space to simply think through complexity—without pressure to have immediate answers—becomes scarce.

**Decisions Beyond Frameworks**
The situations you're working through often resist standard approaches. The acquisition where strategic logic is compelling but integration risks substantial. The restructuring where personal relationships create invisible constraints. These require judgment, not just analysis.

**Seeing System Dynamics**
You recognize patterns others don't yet see—how organizational changes will interact with informal power dynamics, how strategic shifts will encounter cultural resistance in predictable but hard-to-articulate ways. This pattern recognition is valuable but can be isolating.

**The Extended Time Horizon**
Your decisions shape organizational reality over years, not quarters. Developing the leadership bench for challenges that don't exist yet. Shifting culture in ways that enable strategies not yet imagined. Knowing when to invest in capabilities before the market signals become obvious.

---

### Why This Matters

The decisions you're making now have consequences that compound over time—not just in financial results, but in organizational capability, in the leaders you develop, in the strategic options that remain available years from now.

What you're building—the organizations you shape, the leaders you develop, the decision-making cultures you establish—outlasts individual tenures. Today's choices about capabilities, partnerships, and positioning create the set of scenarios your organization can pursue tomorrow. Some paths remain open. Others quietly foreclose.

At senior levels, the difference between good and slightly better judgment—repeated across dozens of consequential decisions—creates divergent trajectories over time.

---

### Working Together

I work with senior leaders who understand that sustained effectiveness at this level benefits from thinking partners who have navigated similar terrain—who can engage with both the strategic complexities and the human dynamics that shape how decisions actually unfold.

### Partnership for the Long Game

The work we do together focuses on challenges that don't fit established frameworks—organizational decisions with human complexity, strategic choices that unfold over years, leadership transitions that reshape what's possible.

### Core Services

**Executive Coaching**
One-on-one partnership focused on the challenges in front of you right now. We work through what matters, without preset methodology determining the conversation.

- Navigating restructuring that carries political complexity
- Working through team dynamics affecting execution
- Thinking through career decisions across multiple timeframes
- Examining patterns you're seeing but haven't fully articulated

**Strategic Advisory**
Thinking through organizational and business challenges that require both analytical rigor and understanding of human systems.

- Assessing market entry where timing and approach determine outcomes
- Designing organizations that enable strategy while remaining sustainable
- Integrating acquisitions where culture shapes financial performance
- Building capabilities that create competitive advantage over time

**Leadership Transition Support**
The first 90 days in a senior role often determine what becomes possible over the following years. We work through what this specific position requires and how to be effective from the outset.

- Establishing credibility while learning organizational dynamics
- Making early decisions that shape future possibilities
- Building relationships that enable execution
- Reading signals that reveal what this role truly demands

**Board Preparation & Development**
Preparing for board service or navigating the unique demands of effective board membership. Understanding what distinguishes governance from executive leadership.

### Specialized Areas

**Organizational Transformation**
Leading change across organizations means understanding that the rational case rarely determines outcomes. Twenty years leading global transformation taught me where resistance emerges and how to create genuine conditions for change—not just compliance that looks like commitment.

**Building New Capabilities**
Launching what doesn't yet exist requires managing the tension between speed and sustainability. Hiring for roles you've never defined. Building credibility in markets where you're unproven. Scaling capabilities across geographies and cultures.

**P&L Leadership**
Full accountability changes how you see decisions. Understanding not just strategy but the operational realities that determine whether strategy translates to results—allocating resources when investment cases compete, building teams when talent is scarce, balancing short-term performance with long-term capability.

**Executive Team Dynamics**
Senior teams rarely fail for lack of individual capability. The work involves understanding what distinguishes the exceptional from the adequate—managing tension between functional excellence and enterprise optimization, building trust when performance pressure is high, navigating power dynamics that shape what gets discussed.

---

### How We Work Together

**Initial Conversation**
We begin with a straightforward discussion about what you're navigating and whether working together makes sense. No formal intake process—simply a thoughtful conversation about whether my experience matches your needs and whether the working relationship feels right.

**Engagement Design**
If we decide to work together, we design an approach that fits your situation. Regular coaching sessions (typically bi-weekly or monthly), intensive advisory on specific decisions, or structured transition support for new roles. The structure serves the work, not the other way around.

**The Work Itself**
Sessions focus on what matters right now. We think through implications, examine assumptions, and consider approaches with both analytical rigor and understanding of human systems.

---

### What Makes This Different

**Experience-Informed Perspective**
This isn't coaching from theory or frameworks—it's partnership informed by having been responsible for outcomes in similar terrain. Having built businesses, led transformations, launched new capabilities, and served on boards provides specific insight into the challenges you're navigating.

**Both Strategic and Human**
Effective work at senior levels requires holding both dimensions simultaneously. The analytical rigor to think through strategic implications. The understanding of organizational dynamics to know what's actually feasible. The capacity to see how they interact. Most advisors bring one. Sustained effectiveness requires both.

---

### Investment

Fee structure matters less than whether this partnership will genuinely serve what you're trying to accomplish. Executive coaching typically involves monthly retainers. Strategic advisory is usually project-scoped. Transition support combines intensive initial engagement with tapering frequency.

I work with a limited number of leaders at any given time. This allows depth of engagement rather than surface-level advice.

## PROFILE

### The Path That Shapes How I Work

Understanding what senior leaders navigate comes from having walked similar terrain. Twenty years building businesses, leading transformations, making consequential decisions—not advising from the outside, but carrying P&L responsibility and living with the outcomes.

In 2024, I stepped away from BCG to work more directly with leaders, without the structure and methodology of a large firm mediating those relationships. What matters isn't the positions held, but what accumulated experience teaches about how organizations actually work, where initiatives fail, what distinguishes sustainable outcomes from surface-level change.

---

### What Experience Teaches

**The Distance Between Strategy and Reality**
Carrying P&L responsibility teaches what frameworks alone cannot: understanding the organizational dynamics that determine whether plans translate into outcomes. The space between strategic logic and implementation reality is where most initiatives fail.

**How Organizations Actually Change**
Leading transformation across 25,000+ professionals reveals that change is fundamentally about human systems. How informal power works. Where resistance emerges. What creates genuine conditions for change versus compelling presentations.

**Building What Doesn't Yet Exist**
Launching new capabilities—hiring for undefined roles, integrating new ways of working into established culture—requires judgment about when to push and when to work with organizational patterns.

**The Board-Level View**
Fourteen years of board service reveals governance patterns: dynamics between boards and management, effective oversight versus compliance theater, how fiduciary responsibility shapes decisions.

### Who I Work With

My practice focuses on senior executives navigating the specific challenges that come with leading at the highest organizational levels. The common thread isn't title—it's the nature of the questions you're holding.

**C-Suite Leaders**
CEOs, COOs, CFOs, and other C-level executives managing enterprise-wide complexity and making decisions that shape organizational trajectory.

**Senior Executives**
Leaders one or two levels from the top, running divisions or functions with significant autonomy and preparing for broader enterprise roles.

**Board Members**
Directors navigating governance challenges, board dynamics, and the unique demands of providing strategic counsel at the highest level.

What brings people to this work is less about their position and more about what they're navigating: decisions without clear precedents, complexity that remains largely invisible, consequences that unfold over years.

## WORK

### Selected Work

Twenty years building businesses, transforming global operations, and creating capabilities that didn't previously exist. The work below represents initiatives where strategy met implementation reality—where understanding both organizational systems and human dynamics determined what actually became possible.

---

### Establishing BCG's Global Capability Center

Leading the establishment and growth of BCG's India-based Global Capability Center—building an operation from inception to serve the firm's worldwide client work.

The challenge wasn't simply operational setup. It was creating an integrated capability that maintained BCG's quality standards while building an entirely new talent model and operating approach.

**Building from Zero:** Defining new role profiles, hiring criteria that balanced technical capability with cultural fit, operational processes that integrated with global teams across time zones. Each decision set precedents for permanent organizational infrastructure.

**Cultural Integration:** The GCC needed to function as an integrated part of BCG's global system—understanding firm culture, building relationships across geographies, establishing trust with senior stakeholders who initially questioned whether this model could maintain quality standards.

---

### Developing BCG's Employee Value Proposition

Leading the development and implementation of BCG's global Employee Value Proposition—articulating what the firm offers its 30,000 professionals and why someone would choose to build their career here.

**Stakeholder Complexity:** Engaging senior leaders across regions, practice areas, and functions—each with legitimate but often competing perspectives. Creating space for genuine dialogue while moving toward decisions.

**Global, Yet Local:** An EVP that worked globally while respecting regional realities. What resonates in New York differs from what matters in Singapore or São Paulo.

**From Articulation to Practice:** The greater challenge wasn't articulating the EVP—it was embedding it in how the organization actually operated. Ensuring the gap between stated values and lived experience didn't quietly undermine credibility.

---

### Leading BCG's Analytics & Product Business

Building and leading a global team of 300+ analytics and product professionals—creating a new capability that didn't exist when I started. The work combined P&L accountability with the challenge of integrating a fundamentally different talent model into BCG's established consulting culture.

**Building a New Practice:** Defining role profiles for data scientists and product managers in a consulting context, building hiring processes, establishing career paths. Each decision set precedents for how this capability would develop.

**Cultural Integration:** Analytics professionals think differently than traditional consultants. They value different things, work at different rhythms, define success through different measures. Building a team that maintained its distinct identity while integrating seamlessly with case teams worldwide.

**P&L Accountability:** Full responsibility for business performance—revenue, profitability, resource allocation, investment decisions. Managing the tension between building long-term capability and delivering quarterly results.

---

### Executive Coaching Practice

Providing executive coaching to senior leaders navigating challenges that resist standard frameworks. What makes this effective is the combination of coaching methodology with direct experience leading similar initiatives.

Most engagements center on specific challenges: organizational restructuring with political complexity, strategic decisions where multiple valid paths exist, leadership transitions requiring different capabilities than what brought them to this level.

The work requires engaging with both the analytical substance and the human dynamics—the strategic logic of a decision, the organizational politics that shape feasibility, how to navigate stakeholder relationships while maintaining forward movement.

---

### Leading Organizational Restructuring

Serving as Head of People for a nonprofit organization navigating fundamental restructuring—rethinking organizational design, reporting relationships, and how work gets done.

**Structural Redesign:** Understanding current state, identifying inefficiencies, designing new operating models. Making decisions about spans of control, reporting relationships, role definitions.

**The Human Dimension:** Restructuring affects people's lives—job security, career trajectory, daily working relationships, sense of purpose. Holding space for legitimate anxiety while maintaining forward momentum.

**Nonprofit Complexity:** Board governance structures, mission-driven cultures, resource limitations, stakeholder complexity. Solutions that work in corporate contexts often need significant adaptation.
