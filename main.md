I'll research executive coaching and consulting websites first to understand how they communicate with senior executives, then create detailed copy for Chris's CAH Advisory website.Based on my research of executive coaching and consulting sites, I can see the best ones speak plainly, avoid buzzwords, and communicate authority through experience rather than marketing language. Let me create detailed copy for Chris's CAH Advisory website.

## **PAGE 1: HOME**

**`<h1>`** You didn't get here by following the script.

**`<p class="intro">`** Most executives reach the C-suite by mastering what's in front of them. The role itself demands something different: seeing around corners, building organizations that outlast your tenure, making decisions when the data is incomplete and the stakes are high.

**`<p>`** I work with senior executives who recognize that getting better at this work requires a different kind of partnership—someone who has built businesses, led transformations, and wrestled with the same questions you're facing now.

**`<h2>`** What I bring

**`<p>`** Twenty years at Boston Consulting Group, where I built new businesses from the ground up, led global HR transformation, ran P&L operations, and helped launch BCG's analytics and digital capabilities. I've been the person in the room when the strategy looks good on paper but the organization isn't ready. I've led teams through changes they didn't ask for. I've made the decision to kill projects that weren't working.

**`<p>`** Before starting my own practice, I served as Executive Director of Global HR Transformation and Change at BCG, and as Global Product Business Senior Director, where I had full P&L responsibility and built business units that generated meaningful revenue. I understand what it means to be accountable for both results and people.

**`<p>`** I'm a certified executive coach (ICF ACC, CEC) because the technical tools matter, but I also know that coaching at this level isn't about frameworks. It's about creating space to think clearly when everyone wants your answer immediately.

**`<h2>`** How we work together

**`<p>`** This isn't coaching that focuses on your "leadership presence" or finding your authentic voice. You already have those. This is about the specific challenges in front of you: the organizational move that everyone says can't be done, the dynamic on your executive team that's slowing everything down, the next phase of your career that doesn't have a clear playbook.

**`<p>`** We work through:

**`<ul>`**
- **`<li>`** Strategic decisions where the technical answer is clear but the organizational reality is complicated
- **`<li>`** Building and restructuring teams when you need both the analytical rigor and the human judgment
- **`<li>`** Transitions—new role, new company, new set of expectations that come with a seat you've never held before
- **`<li>`** Culture and change work that needs to be more than a communications plan
- **`<li>`** Board readiness and governance questions as you prepare for or navigate board service

**`</ul>`**

**`<h2>`** Who this is for

**`<p>`** I work with executives who are one or two levels from the top, sitting CEOs, and board members. You're dealing with questions that don't have obvious answers. You're managing complexity that most people in your organization can't see. You know that getting outside perspective matters, but you don't have time for someone who needs to learn your business from scratch.

**`<p>`** You've probably already worked with consultants who delivered a deck. You might have worked with a coach who asked good questions but didn't understand the business context. What you need now is both: someone who can think through the strategic implications and help you navigate the organizational and personal dimensions at the same time.

**`<h2>`** Start here

**`<p>`** Most engagements begin with a conversation about what you're working on and whether this partnership makes sense. No questionnaires, no intake forms—just a direct discussion about whether I can be useful to you right now.

## **PAGE 2: SERVICES**

**`<h1>`** Services

**`<p class="intro">`** I work in two modes: as an executive coach for individual leaders, and as a strategic advisor for organizational challenges that require both analytical rigor and implementation support.

**`<h2>`** Executive Coaching

**`<p>`** Executive coaching at this level isn't about developing skills you don't have. You already know how to lead, make decisions, and drive results. This work is about the specific challenges you're facing right now—challenges that require thinking differently, acting with more precision, or navigating dynamics that are more complex than anything in your background prepared you for.

**`<p>`** We work together over time, typically in monthly or bi-weekly sessions. The work is confidential, focused on your agenda, and designed to help you move forward on the things that matter most. Between sessions, you're operating with whatever we've worked through. The goal is for you to make progress on real problems, not to have interesting conversations.

**`<h3>`** What we focus on:

**`<p>`** **New executive transitions:** You've taken on a bigger role—CEO, COO, division president, board seat. The job is different from what you've done before, and you're figuring out how to be effective in it. We work through questions like: What does this role actually require? Where should you be spending your time? How do you build the relationships that matter? What needs to change in how you operate?

**`<p>`** **Team and organizational challenges:** Something isn't working on your executive team or in your organization, and fixing it requires more than a reorganization or a new hire. The dynamics are complex, the stakes are high, and you need to think through what's really going on and how to address it. We work on understanding the patterns, making sense of what you're seeing, and designing interventions that might actually work.

**`<p>`** **Strategic decisions with organizational implications:** You're facing a decision where the analytical answer is clear but the organizational reality makes it complicated. You need to think through not just what to do, but how to do it, who needs to be involved, what will break if you move forward, and how to set things up for success.

**`<p>`** **Building and restructuring organizations:** You're scaling, integrating an acquisition, restructuring for a new strategy, or building a function from scratch. The work requires both the strategic logic and the organizational design—how the pieces fit together, what roles need to exist, how the work flows, what you're optimizing for.

**`<p>`** **Change and culture:** You need to move the organization in a direction it hasn't gone before. Not a "change management plan," but the actual work of figuring out what needs to be different, how to create the conditions for it to happen, and how to lead through the resistance and confusion that comes with real change.

**`<p>`** **Career and board considerations:** You're thinking about what comes next. That might mean preparing for a CEO role, considering a board seat, evaluating an offer, or figuring out what you want your next chapter to look like. We work through the decision-making, the positioning, and the preparation required to move in the direction you want.

**`<h3>`** How it works:

**`<p>`** Engagements are typically 6 to 12 months, though some clients work with me longer as their priorities evolve. We meet virtually, usually for 90 minutes per session. The frequency depends on what you're working on—monthly for ongoing development, more frequent when you're in the middle of something complex.

**`<p>`** Between sessions, you're working on what we've discussed. The coaching isn't separate from your work; it's integrated into how you're thinking about and approaching the challenges in front of you.

**`<h2>`** Strategic Consulting

**`<p>`** Some situations require more than coaching. You need someone who can analyze the problem, develop the strategy, and work alongside your team to implement it. This is consulting work, but not the kind where a team shows up, studies your organization, and hands you a deck. This is partnership on specific challenges where both the thinking and the execution matter.

**`<h3>`** Where I add value:

**`<p>`** **Strategic planning and execution:** You're setting strategy for your organization or business unit. You need help with the analytical work—market assessment, competitive positioning, scenario planning—but you also need to ensure the strategy can actually be executed. I bring the consulting toolkit: structured problem-solving, rigorous analysis, clear recommendations. But I also bring the operational experience to help you think through the implementation: what needs to be true organizationally, what's realistic given your constraints, how to sequence the work.

**`<p>`** **HR transformation and people strategy:** Your HR function or people strategy needs to evolve. Maybe you're scaling, dealing with a new business model, or recognizing that how you attract, develop, and retain talent isn't working anymore. I've led global HR transformation at a professional services firm with thousands of people. I know what good looks like, where most organizations get stuck, and how to design people strategies that connect to business priorities.

**`<p>`** **Organizational design and operating model:** You're restructuring, combining organizations, or setting up a new business unit. You need to figure out the right design: roles, reporting lines, decision rights, governance. But you also need to think through the transitions, the communication, the risks. I help you design the end state and plan the path to get there.

**`<p>`** **Change and transformation programs:** You're leading a significant change—digital transformation, integration, turnaround, culture shift. You need someone who can help shape the approach, work with your leadership team, and provide counsel as you navigate the complexity. I don't run your change program, but I work alongside you to make sure the strategy is sound and you're seeing around the corners.

**`<p>`** **Board and governance advisory:** You're building a board, improving board effectiveness, or working through a governance challenge. I've served on a nonprofit board for over 14 years, including executive committee and officer roles. I understand board dynamics, what makes boards effective, and how to work through common board challenges.

**`<h3>`** How it works:

**`<p>`** Projects are scoped based on the specific need. Some are short-term—a few weeks to develop a strategy or solve a particular problem. Others are ongoing, where I serve as an advisor over several months as you implement something complex.

**`<p>`** I work directly with you and your team. No junior consultants, no large teams that add cost without adding value. You get me, my experience, and my judgment.

**`<h2>`** Approach

**`<p>`** Whether I'm working as a coach or consultant, the approach is the same: clarity about the problem, rigor in the thinking, pragmatism about what will actually work in your context.

**`<p>`** I don't have a methodology I'm trying to sell you. I have experience building businesses, leading change, and helping organizations work through complex challenges. I bring that experience, and we figure out together what makes sense for your situation.

**`<p>`** The work is confidential, direct, and focused on helping you make progress on what matters most.

## **PAGE 3: PROFILE**

**`<h1>`** Profile

**`<p class="intro">`** I'm Chris Howe. I spent 20 years at Boston Consulting Group, where I built businesses, led transformations, and worked with companies across industries on their most complex challenges. I now work with senior executives as a coach and strategic advisor.

**`<h2>`** Background

**`<p>`** My career at BCG wasn't linear. I started as a consultant working on strategy projects, became a principal and then a case team leader, and eventually moved into building and running businesses within the firm.

**`<p>`** As Global Product Business Senior Director, I built a business unit from scratch focused on software and data products. I had full P&L responsibility for a services business line and the ONE data platform. That meant making investment decisions, building teams, figuring out go-to-market strategy, and being accountable for revenue and growth. It wasn't theoretical strategy work—it was line management with all the complexity that comes with it.

**`<p>`** Before that, I launched BCG's analytics solutions business, which required hiring at scale, building capabilities in new markets including India, and creating the foundation for what became a significant part of BCG's digital practice. We brought in data scientists, engineers, and product managers—roles that didn't exist in the firm before—and built something that changed how BCG worked with clients.

**`<p>`** I also served as Executive Director of Global HR Transformation and Change, leading how BCG thought about its people strategy, talent development, and organizational effectiveness. That role gave me insight into how professional services firms really work, where HR functions break down, and what it takes to align people strategy with business priorities.

**`<p>`** Earlier in my career, I was Chief of Staff to the head of BCG's global practice areas, which meant seeing how the firm actually ran—not the public-facing strategy work, but the internal decision-making, resource allocation, and organizational dynamics that determined what got done and what didn't.

**`<p>`** I left BCG in 2024 to start my own practice. After two decades of working within one organization, I wanted to work more directly with leaders and organizations on the challenges they're facing, without the infrastructure and methodology of a large firm.

**`<h2>`** Before BCG

**`<p>`** I spent three years at A.T. Kearney as an associate, working primarily in New York and Washington, D.C. That experience gave me the foundation in consulting—how to structure problems, work with clients, and deliver under pressure.

**`<p>`** I have an MBA from the University of Virginia's Darden School of Business and a B.S. in Commerce from the University of Virginia.

**`<h2>`** Board service

**`<p>`** I've served on the board of DreamYard Project since 2011. DreamYard is the largest arts education provider in the Bronx and one of the largest in New York City, working with thousands of K-12 students each year. I'm a member of the Executive Committee and serve as Head of the People and Culture Committee, which oversees HR strategy, organizational development, and the employee value proposition.

**`<p>`** Board service at DreamYard has been a significant part of my work over the past 14 years. It's given me experience with governance, fiduciary responsibility, strategic planning for nonprofits, and the particular challenges of scaling a mission-driven organization.

**`<h2>`** Coaching credentials

**`<p>`** I'm a certified executive coach with credentials from two organizations: the International Coaching Federation (ACC) and the Center for Executive Coaching. I completed training in strategic planning and execution, culture change, perceptual shift coaching, and data and digital platforms.

**`<p>`** The credentials matter because they reflect a commitment to the discipline and practice of coaching. But what matters more is the work I've done—building businesses, leading teams, making difficult decisions—which gives me the context to coach at the executive level.

**`<h2>`** How I think about this work

**`<p>`** Most of my career was spent inside organizations, dealing with the reality that strategy is only useful if it can be implemented, and implementation only works if you understand the people, culture, and organizational dynamics involved.

**`<p>`** That's the perspective I bring as a coach and advisor. I'm not an academic who studies leadership. I'm someone who has led people, built businesses, managed P&Ls, and worked through the same kinds of challenges my clients are facing.

**`<p>`** I know what it's like to be accountable for results when the path forward isn't obvious. I know the isolation that comes with senior roles, where the decisions are yours to make and the consequences are yours to live with. I know that getting better at this work requires more than new skills—it requires different thinking, clearer judgment, and the discipline to focus on what actually matters.

**`<p>`** That's what I help executives develop.

**`<p>`** **LinkedIn:** [linkedin.com/in/chris-howe-ny](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-howe-ny)

**`<h2>`** What to expect

**`<p>`** Most engagements begin with a direct conversation—typically 30 to 45 minutes—where we discuss what you're working on and whether I can be useful to you.

**`<p>`** There's no formal intake process, no questionnaires to fill out. Just a straightforward discussion about your situation, what you're trying to accomplish, and whether this partnership makes sense.

**`<p>`** If it seems like a fit, we talk about how to structure the work—coaching, consulting, or some combination—and what that would look like in terms of time commitment and fee structure.

**`<p>`** If it's not a fit, I'll tell you that directly and, if possible, point you toward other resources that might be more useful.

**`<h2>`** Who I work with

**`<p>`** My clients are senior executives—C-suite, one level below the C-suite, and board members. They're typically leading organizations or business units with significant complexity: multiple stakeholders, ambiguous problems, high stakes.

**`<p>`** Some are in role and dealing with specific challenges. Others are in transition—new position, new company, preparing for a board seat. All of them are facing questions that don't have obvious answers and recognize that working through those questions with someone who has relevant experience can be valuable.

**`<p>`** I work with executives across industries—technology, financial services, healthcare, professional services, nonprofits. What matters isn't the industry; it's the nature of the work and whether my experience is relevant to what you're dealing with.

**`<h2>`** Location

**`<p>`** I'm based in New York City. All coaching and advisory work is conducted virtually, though I can work on-site for specific consulting projects when that makes sense.
