                        <p>Leading change across organizations means understanding that the rational case rarely determines outcomes. Twenty years leading global transformation taught me where resistance emerges and how to create genuine conditions for change—not just compliance that looks like commitment.</p>

Regular coaching sessions (typically bi-weekly or monthly), intensive advisory on specific decisions, or structured transition support for new roles. The structure serves the work, not the other way around.</p>

                    <p>This isn't coaching from theory or frameworks—it's partnership informed by having been responsible for outcomes in similar terrain. Having built businesses, led transformations, launched new capabilities, and served on boards provides specific insight into the challenges you're navigating.</p>

                    <p>Effective work at senior levels requires holding both dimensions simultaneously. The analytical rigor to think through strategic implications. The understanding of organizational dynamics to know what's actually feasible. The capacity to see how they interact. Most advisors bring one. Sustained effectiveness requires both.</p>

                <p>Fee structure matters less than whether this partnership will genuinely serve what you're trying to accomplish. Executive coaching typically involves monthly retainers. Strategic advisory is usually project-scoped. Transition support combines intensive initial engagement with tapering frequency.</p>
                <p>I work with a limited number of leaders at any given time. This allows depth of engagement rather than surface-level advice.</p>
